This project focuses on analyzing the Microsoft Malware dataset derived from Kaggle's Microsoft Malware Prediction competition. The dataset consists of Windows machines' data, and the goal is to predict the probability of a machine being infected by various families of malware based on the machine's properties.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset contains a simplified version of the original Kaggle dataset for learning purposes. Each record represents a machine running the Microsoft Windows OS, and the aim is to use both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to extract meaningful insights and make predictions.


**Project Workflow**

**1. Supervised Learning**

The objective of this part is to apply supervised learning techniques to predict the probability of malware infection based on the machine properties.

Steps:

**Data Import and Exploration:**

Import the dataset.

Perform a basic data exploration phase to understand the structure of the dataset.

Display general information (e.g., dataset shape, data types, and summary statistics).

**Data Profiling:**

Create a Pandas profiling report to gain insights into the dataset and better understand the features.

**Data Cleaning:**

Handle missing and corrupted values.
Remove any duplicates, if they exist.

Handle outliers, if they exist.

**Feature Engineering:**

Encode categorical features into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

**Model Preparation:**

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Prepare the dataset for modeling by normalizing or standardizing features.

**Decision Tree Model:**

Apply a Decision Tree model to predict malware infection probability.

Plot the ROC Curve for the model's performance evaluation.

**Model Optimization:**

Tune hyperparameters to improve the performance of the Decision Tree model.

**2. Unsupervised Learning**

The aim of this section is to apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify machine clusters based on their properties.

Steps:

**Prepare Data for Clustering:**

Drop the target variable, as it's not needed for unsupervised learning.

**K-Means Clustering:**

Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to find patterns within the dataset.

Plot the resulting clusters to visualize the grouping of machines.

**Optimal K Parameter:**

Find the optimal number of clusters (K) by the Elbow Method

**Interpret Results:**

Analyze and interpret the clustering results to identify distinct machine profiles and patterns.
